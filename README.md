# InNight
This App aims to help the managment of events.

***InNight*** provides on the one hand the possibility to manage the event by the actors involved, on the other hand the possibility to participate in a given event through simple QR-codes produced by the application.

It is an application the target users are event organizers and their collaborators; in particular they can have the role of **Admin**, **Collaborator**, **Promoter** and **Box-Office**.

The Admin and the **Collaborator** can perform the same functions within the App, i.e. they can create and edit an event, they can assign one or more roles between **Collaborator**, **Promoter** and **Box-Office** to collaborators for that specific event, and they can view the list of those booked to that event. The only difference is that only the Admin can delete the event, while the **Collaborator** cannot.

The **Promoter**, on the other hand, can view the list of booked and himself add participants to that e- wind through the app, entering the data of the users he wants to register for the event and sharing the generated **QR-code** with them.

However, the booking process can also take place through a link in the eventâ€™s recap. That link redirects to a web page, through which the users themselves can book themselves to that event by entering the required data while filling in. Upon completion, a QR-code will be generated, which can be scanned by the **Box-office** figure to verify the validity of the reservation.

This also makes it very easy to share the event, as all that is needed is for the Admin or contributors to forward the event link via chat or social, also increasing the visibility of the event.

A registration system is provided via username, email and password, or simply via Apple account.
